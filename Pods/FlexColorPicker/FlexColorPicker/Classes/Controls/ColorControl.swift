/// Protocol to which all color picker controls must conform. This protocol defines contract of *color controls*.
///
/// A *color control* is standalone view that should subclass `UIControl` and which can be used to pick a color. Value of *color control* is stored in `selectedHSBColor` property.
///
/// *Color control* sends `UIControlEvents.valueChanged` events to registered targets when its value (`selectedHSBColor`) changes as consequence of user interaction with the control. A *color control* can also send `UIControlEvents.primaryActionTriggered` when user takes action to confirm current selected color as final.
///
/// A *color control* should be usable as standalone component but is usually used together with other *color controls* managed and synchronized by instance of `ColorPickerController`.
public protocol ColorControl: AnyObject {
    /// Override this and return `false` if you do not want `UIControlEvents.primaryActionTriggered` events sent by the color control to be considered confirmation of color selection.

    /// Sets `selectedHSBColor` and adjusts visual state of the control to its new value.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - hsbColor: New value to be set as selected color of this color control.
    ///   - isInteractive: Whether new selected color was specified programatically or by user via interaction with another control. This can used to determine if some animations should be played.
